# phishing-Simulation
Humans are one of the most vulnerable parts of cyber security so I created a phishing Simulation Campaign using Wizer to deliver cyber security awareness training.

- Attathreat actors will do reconnaissance on sites like Linkedin or use osint tools to find the name, job, title, and position of Authority within a company.

- created a custom phishing email that exploits the employee's sense of urgency, trust, and Greed.

- This is how the phishing email looks from the victim's perspective.

- If the victim clicks on the email and falls for the phishing link it would take them to this website.

- This website will provide users with a short training video where they learn about how to identify a phishing email and what to do if they ever get a phishing email again.
